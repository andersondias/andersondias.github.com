We were late. Team were compromised with a list of functionalities and we didn't achieved our goal. And it's was getting worse. We made a bad prioritization and we gave more attention to lowest priority tasks. We needed to change the course to achieve the expectations.

We were working in a task and it was concluded. It lacked only to put some tips to help users to use it. Nothing critical. We were searching for icons and working on some design issues. But we had a bigger problem in our hands. We were so distracted to this details that we missed a critical functionality.

The Sprint was over. We made a mistake when prioritizing and payed attention to little details. When we realized the mistake we made all the team was moved to end up with the highest priority task. But a question arose: what will happen to the lowest priority task? Theoretically it was not all done.

Software development is a complex process, not a defined one. To manage this kind of process we need to use empirical control processes<sup>1</sup>. Adaptability is a great tool to suit to the emergent chaos of software development.

Schwaber and Beedle<sup>1</sup> said that a "team has the authority to change the functionality of the Sprint so long as it meets its Sprint Goal.". First we need to discover which is the less that attends the needs<sup>2</sup>. Then we need to learn how to reduce scope to meet the least when a Spring Goal is at risk.

Do not deliver everything you planed does not means that you can't put a functionality in production. That's the agile approach. Functionalities are incremental. Development is evolutive. We can deliver a functional software at the first Sprint, and then increase it as it needs.

We changed the scope of the functionality. It will be put on production without some details, but it will meet the need. There will be improvements in the next Sprints. The highest priority task is almost done and will be delivered in next release.

**To achieve the Sprint Goals, change the scope of functionalities.**

And be aware to correct prioritization.
